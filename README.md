# Facial Recogntion 
This project uses face_recognition library and frontal face xml file cloned directly from opencv repo
In this project, the facial encodings are procured from each known face and stored in an array,
These faces along with the label are compared for the encodings for each unknown face and the best match is displayed
This project does not use Machine learning due to the use case having lack of images to train from
This project enables comparision from as low as 1 image to recognise a face
